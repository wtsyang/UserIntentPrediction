What's is left seems to be the App's best attempt to start a great album for you\", \" to summarise the photo's from the day.  In addition to this\", ' it chooses a good album cover photo', ' and also applies the \"\"Enhance\"\" to enhance all the images in the Album.   The result (and ultimate benefit)', ' is that by doing nothing', ' you can just open up your album and immediately have available a good album set to view yourself or show to others.  If you want *all* photo\\'s just go to Collections - which is unfiltered.  So Albums starts off an album for you based on the photo\\'s taken for that day.  I then \\'optimise\\' the album by choosing \"\"Edit\"\" in the top right corner', \" then click + 'Add or Remove photos'.  The logic applied is excellent\", \" although it doesn't always get all the photos you want\", ' so I manually select/de-select photos as appropriate.  I have found this really useful', \" as when taking photo's I do have many duplicates and blurred ones - I also have 100's of photo directories\", \" and going through each one is a) very time consuming and b) I don't like to delete photo's\", ' so the Album is a useful \"\"view\"\" on photo\\'s you want.

The way to do this is to dial +011 + country code + cell number. The Skype app doesn\\'t allow me to input the 011 before country code and make a successful call. It automatically thinks I am trying to call Antartica since I inputted +011- software thinks it is the country code and I can not dial out- but the actual country is after the 011.

NOTE: The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup', ' if it does', ' then press Y to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform chkdsk.  Important:While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost  Method 2:Run Memory Diagnostics  I would also suggest you to run Windows Memory Diagnostics utility. Windows 8.1 includes built-in features to help you identify and diagnose problems with memory.

First delete unused styles', ' then I go through remaining \"\"extra\"\" styles and apply my standard styles before deleting the now unused style. Here are some macros you can play with to find one that works best for you: DETERMINING HOW MANY STYLES ARE AVAILABLE http://word.tips.net/T000803_Determining_How_Many_Styles_are_Available.html Summary: Got a macro that processes or uses styles? You definitely need to know how many styles Word has available in the document. Use the Count property of the Styles collection to determine the figure. FINDING UNUSED STYLES http://word.tips.net/T001488_Finding_Unused_Styles.html Summary: Use this VBA macro to determine which styles are being used in the current Word document. REMOVING UNUSED STYLES http://word.tips.net/T001337_Removing_Unused_Styles.html Summary: Got an older document that has a bunch of unused styles defined in it? You can get rid of those styles easily by using the short macro in this tip DELETE UNUSED STYLES (TAKE 2) http://word.mvps.org/faqs/numbering/RemoveManualNumbers.htm This macro below and at this site is excellent but I notice it does not exactly remove all manually Outlined Numbered paragraphs which have been converted to Normal or Plain text - Like any \"\"Article\"\" heading or even A.', ' B.', ' numbering for certain paragraphs. However', ' it does remove 1.1', ' (a)', ' etc. numbering which I find odd. DELETE UNUSED STYLES (TIP) The use of Style.Delete is not the best way to go. If multiple styles are deleted by the loop the time taken blows out exponentially and will typically be 30 minutes to delete 100 styles. Instead use: Application.OrganizerDelete Source:= ActiveDocument.Path & \"\"\\\\\"\" & ActiveDocument.Name', ' _ Name:=oStyle.NameLocal', \" Object:=wdOrganizerObjectStyles It will then take only a few seconds to delete 100 or more styles. I have a few more (long) macros that don't have links if the above ones don't do it for you. Bonus: STYLE REPORT ADD-IN http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/style_report_addin.html With Style Report\", ' users can quickly loop through the style collection and with the user interface provided make a decision to keep or delete the styles used in a document or previously used styles that are not applied to any text.

Then connect the charger to your laptop’s power port. e.     Power the computer on when using strictly AC power. f.     If your computer is working as intended then your battery is most likely headed for “battery heaven” and will need to be replaced.   If your computer does not work then there may be an issue with the charger or the power port on your computer.

It works with your existing antivirus software. http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx   Note: 1) The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions', \" download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.                                                               2) If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted. Method 2: Refer to the link mentioned below and check if it helps:     Method 3: If the issue does not resolve try to reset the internet explorer and check the issue.

So\", ' I decided to open task manager during the running of a slide with the LiveWeb control to see if I can see any process that were running with the thought of maybe getting a Process Explorer app installed and get more granular.  Windows Task Manager looks like this when hitting the slide with LiveWeb (screen shot inserted)    You\\'ll notice on the third process under Microsoft PowerPoint (32 bit) (3) a process that just shows a \"\"Window Icon\"\" but does not provide any text to indicate what it is.  That line and icon do indeed represent the LiveWeb control. This (as stated in initial post) confirms the add-in is running correct and not erroring or being blocked.  In TaskManager if you right-click that Window Icon and choose \"\"Bring to Front\"\" while on the first pass of viewing that slide the contents display (so a second visit is not needed).   Of course', \" this cannot be done or would not be effective while running the PowerPoint presentation.  In my layman's terms\", \" I believe maybe the embedded control is loosing top window focus and therefore is not seen on the first visit to the slide.

WORKAROUND IN PLACE Again\", ' just sharing information that I am seeing.  My work around has been to create a custom Slide Show with only the slides that have the embedded control and let them cycle through once before the \\'live\\' presentation begins.  I then stop the custom show (without exiting PowerPoint) and run the full show.  All of the content on LiveWeb slides displays perfectly.  I am using the add-in unlike most;  the LiveWeb control is used on 70 different slides to show individual PDF or PNG files. LiveWeb has been a HUGE help to us.

I have attempted a few different browser emulation modes after beginning with the defaults from the LiveWeb FAQ page. Here\\'s the issue I am having: When I visit the slide with the LiveWeb control the very FIRST time the slide ONLY displays a blank page.  If I arrow back one page or use a hyperlink back to another page and then return to the LiveWeb slide I see the embedded webpage as desired.  Once I close the presentation and open it again I have to visit the page once (getting the blank page) then go to another slide and then come back in order  for the page to be displayed and continues to display until I close the presentation and open it again. Testing I have tested on two different machines and multiple profiles to attempt to eliminate any local issues.  I have used both the LiveWeb.exe install process and the ppam add-in steps during my testing. My configuration is: Win10 1703 (Creators Update) Office 2016 .msi  (although I have the same outcome on ClickToRun Machine) patched to July and then August 2017 with Office updates Default MS Edge Browser (I have also set IE as the default during testing) I have tested PowerPoint in Kiosk Mode (the one I\\'d like to use with the add-in) as well as standard \"\"presented by speaker\"\" mode. Both give same results. A thought or two: To add to what I am seeing', ' I can tell the add-in is running because when I run the presentation and hit the slide with LiveWeb control in it and it doesn\\'t display I can \"\"Alt-Tab\"\" and see a process window running with the content.  I cannot open that window from there but it is there.  So', \" I know it is not being 'blocked' and I don't receive any errors.

Anyway I'm not impressed with Skype's attitude to all this - as in my opinion they could have quite easily continued to support Skype users using Android 4.4.2 KitKat by coming out with a Skype Lite version of Skype for mobile users like myself who are quite happy with their Note II mobiles.  Finally there are many alternative's to Skype now - many of which are compatible with previous versions of Android\", \" so naturally I'm inclined to look elsewhere and save money no doubt\", ' into the bargain.\"', '6877', '69291', '4', 'User', 'Stephanie', '0', '2017-09-13T09:51:53', 'Common User', '0', 'Is Skype still supported on Android 4.4.2 Kitkat ?', 'Skype_Android', '2017-08-24T10:26:14', '3']\n",

The only way to reinstall was to take the SSD out and install Windows using another PC before putting the SSD back into my box. Plugging something into USB will almost certainly BSOD it too.

(Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers.)  DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list', ' additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver', ' description', ' version', ' product name', ' company that created the driver', \" and more. http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html  For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.  Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC)\", ' Wifi', ' Sound', \" Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.  Now go to System Maker's site (Dell\", ' HP', \" Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek\", ' Intel', ' Nvidia', ' ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS', \" Chipset and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)  Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.  Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.  Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.  Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites. http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html  If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates\", ' this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.
